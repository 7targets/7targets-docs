Leads from **Pipedrive** CRM can be assigned to 7Targets AI Sales Assistant directly within the Pipedrive UI. AI Assistant will then own the lead and communicate to try and get the meeting. Assistant will also update the lead details putting notes for the emails being sent. Will also move the leads assigned across multiple stages in the Pipeline.

One **important** point to note, as soon as the AI Assistant receives a response from the lead and detects it to be a Hot or Responded lead then the assistant assigns the lead back to the original owner.
