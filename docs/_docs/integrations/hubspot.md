Leads from **Hubspot** CRM can be assigned to 7Targets AI Sales Assistant directly within the Hubspot UI. AI Assistant will then own the lead and communicate to try and get the meeting. Assistant will also update the lead details putting engagement details (email, task) in Hubspot. 

One **important** point to note, as soon as the AI Assistant receives a response from the lead and detects it to be a Hot or Responded lead then the assistant assigns the lead back to the original owner.
