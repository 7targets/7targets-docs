##### Sales Assistant 
Sales Assistant has the responsibility of communicating with the lead over email with an intent of getting a meeting.  More suitable for Sales people who use email as primary mechanism of communication. The default recommended schedule comes with 7 follow-ups with increasing duration between the follow-ups.

Leads can also be added from the UI like for other assistants. This is purely WhatsApp only communication. Today we do 3 follow-ups every 2 days after sending the initial message and this cannot be changed.
