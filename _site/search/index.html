						"content": "When does AI Sales Assistant stop emailing ?\nAI Sales Assistant stops emailing as soon as\n\n  The lead responds.\n  The lead unsubscribes\n  The lead is not interested in our offering\n\n\nIn Sales Assistant, can I add same lead email-id for different context ?\nNo you cannot. You will have to edit the lead and restart the follow-up.\n\nCan I have my company logo in the assistant signature ?\nRight now we do not have the feature to add logo to the signature. Logos, Square boxes, and ‘sales-ly emails’ get a lower response rate compared to plain, simple, direct, conversational emails.\n\nCan I stop sending the WhatsApp URL in the emails sent by the assistant ?\nYes, you can. Go to edit assistant and tick the box appropriately for adding or not adding the direct WhatsApp URL in the email.\n\nWhat names should I use for the AI Assistant to get a good response rate ?\nNames like Rachel, Ashley work well for US, India. Names like Sonia, Sakshi work well within India. France and middle east get higher response rates with local assistant names. Try different  names and let us know how it worked for you. Remember that emails already gone out from one assistant cannot be changed when you change names. Its like hiring a new assistant from the lead perspective.\n\nHow do I decide on the context to be used when adding a lead ?\nOur customers generally create a list of contexts that are relevant for them and publish those to their internal team. All leads getting added, the team uses one of the contexts you approve, so all emails go correctly. The context once used is remembered and is searchable too in that field while adding the lead.\n\nIs there any option to pause the sending of emails?\nYes, you can deactivate the lead. That will stop sending the emails. To restart, can again assign another (or same) sequence/schedule to the lead to restart followups.\n\nIs unsubscribe the only option to stop sending off further messages?\nUnsubscribe is not the option to stop sending emails. Deactivate is the right option to stop sending emails. Unsubscribe is used only when the end-user clicks unsubscribe or write ‘unsubscribe me’ (or something like that) in the email. Then Assistant will automatically unsubscribe the lead. If the Assistant fails to read unsubscribe response for whatever reason, you can manually unsubscribe the lead if the lead requested it specifically.  99% of the time, you will never have to unsubscribe manually.\n\nWhat are the options to send an attachment, videos or photos in the email?\nTwo ways to send attachments, you-tube videos or photos.\n\n\n  Use links (URLs) to those files and videos in the email.\n  Use your normal email client (like gmail) for sending the first email and cc the Assistant in that email.\nThe Assistant understands that she needs to followup that leads using the ‘Email CC’ schedule."

Assistant becomes a virtual team member in your team.\n\nOne important behavior of the assistant is to stop sending more emails on receiving a response from the lead.\n\nAssistant has a default recommended schedule of 7 follow-ups with increasing duration between the follow-ups. User has an option to use custom schedule and change the default schedule too.\n\nAssistant optimizes the email send time for individual lead so that the chances of lead reading the email increases. This is Send Time Optimization.\n\n\nAssistant Profile\nName, Avatar, Email, Phone Number and Signature represents the Assistant identity.\n\nLeads see Name, Email, Phone Number and Signature of the Assistant and these can be edited as appropriate. Phone number is also used to notify you of the WARM and HOT leads on WhatsApp.\n\nAt present you cannot add a image/logo to the signature.\n\n\nAssistant Default\nAssistant has many defaults which are self explanatory. Some of the important ones are mentioned below:\n\n\n  Brochure URL Assistant will embed this URL in the email when responding to requests for Brochure\n  More Context and More Information are the defaults to be used when not provided while adding the leads\n  Lead at Risk Reminder Assistant will remind you after the provided days for 5 times if you forget to reach out to responded leads.\n  Default Schedule Assistant by default uses this schedule for the added leads. e.g. leads added from CRM will use this schedule.\n  Default EmailCC Schedule is used by the assistant when assistant is copied in the email by the user with the lead. For EmailCC schedule, Assistant will start the with second message in the sequence. Your email where you Cc’ed/Copied the assistant is considered as the first email.\n\n\n\nMultiple Assistants\nYou can create multiple assistants for yourself. Assistants cannot be shared or assigned to other users in the Org.\n\nWe recommend to have geography and vertical specific assistants. So that the assistant is trained for nurturing the leads of that vertical with specific nurturing material.\n\nQuestions answered\n\n  Can I add logo in the signature ?\n  Will assistant stop sending emails after response is received ?\n  What will assistant do when it received an email response ?\n  Can I have multiple Assistants ?\n  Why and when should I use multiple assistants ?\n  Should I invite user to 7Targets or create an assistant for that user.

Various possible state are: \nHot if the lead has accepted to meet. \nCold the followup is under progress. \nWarm lead is someone who has opened 3 or more emails. A good list for your calling team to call.\nEngaged lead is someone who has opened 1 or more emails.\nProcessed followup is completed as per the schedule and there was no response from the lead.  \nOut of office received an out of office from the lead. Assistant will restart the followup after lead returns back to office.\nDeactivated lead responded back asking to stop sending emails. \nUnsubscribed lead used the unsubscribed link in the email or responded asking to unsubscribe. \nResponded state for the lead conveys that there is some response from the lead and Assistant was not able to categorize it to one of the above.\nPending means Assistant is still validating the email address of the lead.\nNew conveys that the lead added cannot be processed as you have used up your leads limit as per the plan.

Few of them are Hot and the sales people will engage with them to take the discussion ahead. Remaining need to be owned by someone in marketing or sales operations team to try and reach out multiple times over a period after the event and check if there is a need for what you offer. Such leads when assigned to the AI Assistant with event name as context, the assistant will make sure no lead is dropped.\n\nWebsite as a lead source can be used when the lead has visited your website and provided or submitted the email id. The offering/product/solution will be the right thing to provide in the context for the AI Assistant to write the emails properly.\n\nUpsell is typically used if there is something new or different value to offer to the existing customers.\n\nMeeting and Phone Meeting are to be used for the leads from face to face meeting and phone meetings respectively.

Based on the source and the context of the lead, the Assistant writes short and simple emails to the lead.\n\n\nAdd Multiple Leads\nTo add multiple leads, provide an excel sheet in the format specified in sample excel. Each row would represent one lead and the first row is the title row.\n\nIntelli Import is a feature where Assistant will try and read the excel in your existing format, to save you the hassle of converting it to the expected format.\n\nOnce you provide the Lead Source, Context and More information, review the emails written by the assistant and the email sequence. Change the schedule, if required.\n\nClick on Add Lead. Assistant will start validating each row, and will add the valid leads. Finally Assistant will notify you of the status on email.\n\nYou can look at the status by going to the “Upload History” page.\nClicking the valid and invalid counts will download an excel with the respective leads. Invalid leads file will have the reason too.\nClicking on the Added count will take you the lead list of those leads added from that specific excel file.\n\nLead once added can not be deleted.\n\n\nAdditional Information\nAdditional information is intended to provide more context and details to the lead about your company offerings. Assistant will use this information in emails.\n\n\nSchedule Sequence\nWhile adding leads,the sequence of emails can be seen in the email preview. These sequence are as per the selected Schedule.\n\nDefault schedule for the Assistant is selected, while you can change the Schedule before adding leads. Change of schedule will also change the email sequence for you to review.\n\n\nCustom Email Subject\nAssistant will generate the relevant email subject. This can be overwritten too, though we recommend to use the AI generated Subjects.\n\nYou can edit the Subject while adding the leads from the 7Targets UI. Click the More button in the email preview to see the To, Cc and Subject fields for you to type your own values. If you are using a custom message in a custom schedule, we recommend to have your Custom subject in the Custom message itself.\n\nAssistant will use the same Subject line for each followup email, so that the all the emails are grouped together for the viewer. If you intend to have different subjects for each followup email then you will have to use custom message and each custom message in the schedule can have different custom subject too.\n\nLike Subject, the email body can be changed too. We recommend to create a custom message in a custom schedule if you intend to write your own message instead of editing the message at the time of adding leads. One important best practice to follow while creating your own custom message is to have small 5 seconds reading emails on hand-held devices.\n\nWith the intention to keep the emails light, attachments are not possible. While you can add an image to your emails, it is recommended to avoid adding multiple images to keep it small and quick read.\n\nNote that Assistant will keep the first email in all the followup emails so that the Context is maintained. Even if the lead reads one of the followup emails, the context is there for the lead.\n\n\nWays to Assign Lead\nLeads can be added or assigned to the Assistant in multiple ways:\n\n  Add one lead at a time from 7Targets UI\n  Add multiple leads from 7Targets UI by uploading an excel file\n  Copy or Cc your Assistant in the email you are sending to a lead. Have to enable this feature in Edit Assistant\n  If you are integrated with CRM, then assign the Lead/Contact from CRM to the Assistant User in CRM\n\n\nQuestions answered\n\n  Can I add multiple leads ?\n  What are the various different ways of assigning leads to the Assistant ?\n  How can I assign a schedule to the lead or leads ?\n  How can I change the subject for the emails being sent by the Assistant ?\n  Will assistant maintain the first email in the followup emails ?\n  Will all the emails have the same Subjects ?\n  Can I have different Subjects for each email ?\n  Can I write my own message and sequence ? i.e. custom schedule and custom message ?\n  Can I add attachment to the email ?\n  Can I add image to the email ?\n  Is there a possibility to delete the existing data ?"
