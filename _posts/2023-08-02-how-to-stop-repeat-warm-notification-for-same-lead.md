Yes you can stop repeat WARM notification for the same lead and same schedule. This is configurable at Assistant->Notifications->Warm Lead Notification.

This stops repeat WARM Lead notification for 180 days. If the same lead becomes WARM again after 180 then you will receive the WARM notification.
