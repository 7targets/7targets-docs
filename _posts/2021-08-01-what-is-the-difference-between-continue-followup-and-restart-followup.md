## Continue Followup

Assistant stops sending any further messages to the lead after one of the below happens:
1. a response is received from the lead
1. all the messages are sent out as per the schedule for the lead

You may need to continue follow-up for situation 1 above. Or may have added more followup messages to the schedule and in that case may need to send the remaining messages from the schedule to the lead.

**Continue Followup** action helps you to let the follow-ups be continued from where it stopped.

You can do it for one lead at a time or for multiple. Lets look at the steps below for multiple leads.


## Step-1 

Go to 'Leads' and filter by the Processed state. Click on 'Apply'.
