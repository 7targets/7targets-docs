Assistants job ends when we get a HOT response.  
Hot leads need to be taken up directly on direct email by sales guys to take the conversation forward.  
If after conversation with the HOT lead, you send a proposal, thats when you can again copy the assistant.  
This will ensure the lead is not dropped after sending the proposal. Assistant will follow up after proposal is sent.
