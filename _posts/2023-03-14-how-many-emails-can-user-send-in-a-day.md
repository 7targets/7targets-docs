An assistant can send 50 emails per day in Steady Plan. 100 emails per day in Go Plan. and 200 emails per day in Run plan. [https://7targets.ai/us-pricing.html](https://7targets.ai/us-pricing.html)

You can schedule the emails to go at different times with same assistant. Assistant will consider your time in the first few emails. Once the lead opens an email, the assistant changes the time for THAT lead based on what time he opened that email. Assistant would have even optimized the send time to make sure that emails are delivered to the lead at a time when he/she opens the email.
