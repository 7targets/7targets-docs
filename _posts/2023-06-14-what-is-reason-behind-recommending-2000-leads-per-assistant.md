Discover the logic behind the guidance to maintain 2000 leads per assistant. This post sheds light on how this recommendation optimizes communication efficiency and aligns with email sending limits, ensuring effective lead management.

## The Basis: Email Sending Limits

The recommendation to cap the number of leads at 2000 per assistant stems from email sending limitations imposed by Google. To prevent potential spam issues, Google restricts sending over 250 emails per day from a single email address. As a result, our assistants are designed with a safety margin of 200 emails per day.

## Efficient Workload Handling

Assigning 2000 leads per assistant ensures a balanced workload distribution. For instance, with 1000 leads, sending one email to each lead takes approximately a week. In contrast, having 2000 leads extends this cycle to around two weeks per lead.

## Catering to Diverse Needs

This number accommodates the diverse needs of both new and older leads. New leads may require multiple emails in their initial month, whereas emails to older leads are often sent at longer intervals.

## Scaling for Larger Lead Counts

For scenarios exceeding 2000 leads, the recommendation involves creating additional assistants. Cloning an existing assistant facilitates this process. Employing multiple assistants ensures swift and efficient communication, aligning with our premium package's capabilities.

## Optimizing Lead Handling

Considering optimal workflows and the capabilities of our premium package, managing 4 to 5 assistants for a lead count of 6000 significantly improves efficiency. This approach guarantees each lead receives prompt attention and effective communication.

To sum up, understanding the rationale behind the 2000 leads per assistant recommendation highlights its effectiveness in maintaining smooth communication, adhering to email sending limits, and enhancing overall lead management.
