There are 2 scenarios when it comes to attching a document to an email in 7Targets.
1. If you are using EmailCC feature, where you are cc'ing the assistant, you can attach the document and cc the assistant. Assistant will followup.

2. If you are looking at a custom message inside 7Targets, you cannot attach a document. You have to put a link to the document. If you are using DocuLens, use Doculens link. It will provide you insights into which pages of your document was seen by the user.
