Email id of the assistant is `<assistant_name>@<org_name>.<some_domain>.com`. Each 7Targets account can have only one org_name, there could be multiple users and each user can have multiple assistants for one account in 7Targets, but all the assistants would be for the same org_name. 

If one needs a different org_name in the assistant's email then it would mean another account has to be created in 7Targets.
