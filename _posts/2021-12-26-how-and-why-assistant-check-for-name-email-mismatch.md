We have seen this happens with some of our customers. By mistake, while working with the excel file to be uploaded, the name and email column values ended up not matching. In one case, it was just one row moved out. i.e. name of the lead was matching with the email in the next row.  

Such mistakes are very costly. In physical world, one would expect the Sales Assistant to identify and let know such inadvertent mistakes. 

7Targets AI Sales Assistant now has this capability. Using machine learning along with a proprietary algorithm, your Assistant will try to identify such mistakes and inform you over email. You can then correct the data and upload the excel file again or "Proceed as is" if required. 

## Step-1 

Upload an excel file.
