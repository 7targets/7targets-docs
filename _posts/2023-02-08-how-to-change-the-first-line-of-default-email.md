Yes it is possible. You would have to create a custom schedule and custom message for it.
Below are the steps:
1. On Assistant page, click on Schedule button.
2. Clone the Recommend Schedule. Give a name and description to it.
3. In this cloned schedule, change the first row by selecting Message Type as "Custom MEssage" and for the Message Column, select "Create New".
4. After creating the custom message, save this schedule. Also mark it Default too.
5. Now you can add leads and it will use this schedule by default. So your custom message will be the first message.
