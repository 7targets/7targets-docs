Schedule Sequence helps you decide how you want the assistant to followup. i.e.

**-** how many followups

**-** days between each followup

Assistant comes with two default schedules **Recommended** and **Recommended for Email CC**. You can clone from one of these schedules and create a new one, providing an appropriate name and description.

To know more about scheduling please visit this [page](https://help.7targets.ai/manage-org/organization-schedule/).

Follow these simple steps to create a new schedule.

## Step 1

Sign in to your account.

Click on the 'Organisation' Tab. The Schedule sub-tab is selected.

You can click on the 'View' icon to see the message.

On the right side, you can click on the add and delete icons on any of the rows to add a new message or delete one depending on how many messages you want to have in a schedule.

## Step 10

After saving the schedule you may want to mark it default for the selected/specific Assistant. So that when you add leads for this assistant the default schedule is selected.

the custom schedule gives you the ability to pick the number of followups and the days between each appropriately, along with the messages to be sent on each followup.
