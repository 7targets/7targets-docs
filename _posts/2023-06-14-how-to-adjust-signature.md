## Steps
1. Reduce the size of the images or icons in the signature. You can use an image editing tool to resize them as per your desired dimensions. Once resized, reupload the optimized images to the signature.

2. Place the title in the same line as the name and align both contact numbers in the same line. For example:

Harshita | BDE
Tel -... | Mobile number

By implementing these adjustments, the overall size of the signature will be reduced while maintaining a visually appealing layout.
