Sequence helps you decide how you want the assistant to followup. i.e.

**-** how many followups

**-** days between each followup

Assistant comes with two default schedules **Recommended** and **Recommended for Email CC**. You can clone from one of these schedules and create a new one, providing an appropriate name and description.

To know more about scheduling please visit this page.

You can select from one of the already available schedules that you can clone.
After cloning you can make all the desired changes to it.

To select the sequence, click on the 'Name' field. Type "Recommended" to select that sequence. 

If you want to clone from some other Sequence then search the desired sequence and select it.

Now click the 'Clone' button.

## EmailCC Type
Note that the sequence can be identified as EmailCC Type of sequence. 

EmailCC is a special type, which conveys that the first message is to be skipped and followup starts from 2nd message. As first message is representative of the original message from the user.

## Step 9

After saving the sequence you may want to mark it default for the selected/specific Assistant. So that when you add leads for this assistant the default sequence is selected.

Click on the drop-down arrow as shown. Select the AI assistant you want to assign the new sequence to.

The custom sequence gives you the ability to pick the number of followups and the days between each appropriately, along with the messages to be sent on each followup.
