## [What you get](#what-you-get)
Contacts from JobAdder can be assigned to 7Targets AI Sales Assistant directly from JobAdder. AI Assistant will then own the contact/lead, communicate and nurture to try and get the meeting. Assistant will update the communication details (email) in JobAdder for each contact Assistant is nurturing.

One important point to note, after AI Assistant is done with her job, Assistant will change the status to valid mapped status.

## [Setup Details](#setup-details)

`Important Note` : JobAdder Admin level access is required. Org Admin access on 7Targets is required too. 

If not already authorized yet then Authorize by clicking this link [authorise](https://solution.7targets.com/jobadder-authorize){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  

You can confirm or check your integration connectivity from “Org Messages”->”CRM Details”. Meaning of the status on the CRM Details page is explained below. 

Once Authorization is complete, follow below steps for further configuration.

**1.**  Create individual status for each assistant in JobAdder under `Account->Admin->Contacts->Status`. The status value is in the format `Assign to <assistant email without the part 7ts-e.com>` e.g. ashley@tesla if Assistant's email is ashley@tesla.7ts-e.com.  
Click on Save after adding the status.  

Create as many status as many Assistants you have. So that you can assign to the right assistant from JobAdder itself.

**2.** Go to **"Org Messages"->"CRM Details"** in 7Targets. By clicking the Refresh button verify if the status for each Assistant is created in JobAdder. Against each Assistant you will see the CRM Integration Status. 

## Meaning of CRM Integration Status:  
**ASSISTANT_EXISTS_AS_USER_IN_CRM** : You are all set. Go ahead and assign the contact from JobAdder to the Assistant by changing the status of that Contact in JobAdder. That contact should be seen as lead in 7Targets in 1-2 mins. Assistant should also update the note for the contact in JobAdder.  
**ALL_WORKING_WELL** : All set, it is working well for you. You have already assigned contact in JobAdder to the Assistant and Assistant is working on it too.  
**ASSISTANT_DOES_NOT_EXISTS_AS_USER_IN_CRM** : Go back to step 1 above. If still facing issues drop an email to support@7targets.com.  
**ASSISTANT_NOT_YET_CREATED** : Follow Step 1 onwards.   

**3.** Verify in 7Targets that your Assistant has a Default Context and Default Schedule. It is available on Edit Assistant page. Default context and Default Schedule is used by the Assistant as that cannot be provided as input when the Contact from JobAdder is assigned to the Assistant.

**4.** You are all set, assign a contact in JobAdder to the Assistant and verify that you see the lead in 7Targets in the "Leads" page. As well check that Assistant would have left a note in the Contact Activity in JobAdder.

## [How it works](#how-it-works)
- After the contact in JobAdder is assigned to the Assistant by changing the status, Assistant will own it for nurturing. Assistant will use the default Schedule and Context as configured in 7Targets.
- Assistant will leave a note of confirmation.
- All the emails that Assistant sends or receives are logged in JobAdder too. 
- After Assistant is done with the work, the contact status is changed. For example, if there is a response from the lead, then Assistant will stop further emails and change the status to "Active contact".

## [Lead State to JobAdder Contact State Mapping](#state-mapping-with-jobadder)
Assistant update the JobAdder Contact Status as per the below mapping:

| 7Targets Lead State | JobAdder Contact Status | 
|:-------|:--------|
| Cold | Assign to <assistant email> in 7Targets |
| Engaged | Assign to <assistant email> in 7Targets |
| Warm | Active Contact |
| Hot | Active Contact |
| Responded | Active Contact |
| UnSubscribed | Inactive Contact |
| DeActivated | Inactive Contact |
| Processed | Active Contact |
| New | Active Contact |

## Assignment of JobAdder Contact
One or more contacts from JobAdder can be assigned to the Assistant by changing the status of Contact/s from JobAdder to `Assign to <assistant> in 7Targets` as show in the below image: 

![Assign to Assistant](../../images/jobadder-assign-to-assistant.jpg)  

Re-assignment of a contact from JobAdder would not be picked by the Assistant for processing if already being worked on by the Assistant. This is to avoid accidental re-assignments, when user does multiple select and assign to the Assistant in JobAdder.  
In such a scenario, Assistant would leave a note and change the contact status.
