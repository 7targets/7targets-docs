Assistant validates the email address, if the Email address is not valid then the lead is marked Deactivated->Invalid Email. 

If the sent email bounces back, then the lead is marked as Deactivated. 

On the Lead List page, one could filter by the State as Deactivated and the possible SubState for Deactivated.
