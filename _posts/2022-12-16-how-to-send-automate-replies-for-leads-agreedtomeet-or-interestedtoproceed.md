Some of the leads may respond back agree to meet or interested to proceed further and you may want to send a reply immeditely with your shared calender. So the lead can book the meeting.

This is easily possible now. You have to create the custom message and the preference has to be set for it for that assistant. 

## Preference
Assistant has a preference to respond back automatically if the leads response is classified as "AgreedToMeet" or "InterestedToProceed". 

Based on the selected custom message set in this preference, Assistant will respond back. 

If the custom message is not set then Assistant will not reply back automatically to leads response classified in those classes.
