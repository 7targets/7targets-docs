One possible reason for observing fewer leads in your Excel file compared to the total number of rows is the presence of duplicate email IDs in multiple rows. Duplicate email addresses can result in a discrepancy between the total row count and the number of unique leads. To address this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify and filter duplicate email addresses: Utilize Excel's filtering capabilities to identify and filter out duplicate email addresses in the Email column. This will help you identify the unique leads accurately.

2. Remove duplicate values: Once you have identified the duplicate email addresses, you can remove them from the dataset to ensure each lead is counted only once.
