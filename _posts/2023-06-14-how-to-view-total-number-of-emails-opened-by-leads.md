The "Engaged" count provides the metric of leads who have opened emails. Additionally, the "Warm" count provides a list of leads who have opened more than three emails. To view data specifically for January, you can utilize the filter option on the dashboard. Select the dates from January 1st to the end of January, and it will display the relevant data for that month.

The "Engaged" count represents the total number of emails opened or the total number of leads who have opened our emails. If you want to understand how many of these messages have been opened, it refers to the number of leads who have opened these emails. Since the focus is on lead conversion, there are reports available for leads who have opened at least one email and for leads who have opened multiple emails.
