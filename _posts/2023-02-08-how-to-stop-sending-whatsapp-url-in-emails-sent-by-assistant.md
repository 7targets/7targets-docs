Select the `Preferences` option for an Assistant.
In the `Assistant Defaults and other Options` tab, there will be a `Options` dropdown where a checkbox with `Include Whatsapp Link for phone number in the Email` will be present.
Uncheck the checkbox for not adding the direct WhatsApp URL in the email.
