Your Assistant is identified by name, email address, and title. You can always change the details. We recommend you have industry-specific and geography-specific AI assistants. For example, use Indian sounding name for Indian leads and for use US sounding name for US-based leads.

## Step 6

Enter your company name and the website URL.

If you want your Assistant to send an email from your company domain instead of < yourcompany >.7ts-e.com then you can use this feature.

While creating Assistant, there is an option 'I want to use my own domain'. On clicking it, you would be asked to authorize the email/account you want to use for the Assistant being created. This will be the Assistant’s email id.

After adding all the details, click on the 'Save' button.
