It's possible that the delay in triggering some emails after 7-8 days is due to various factors related to workload and email validation. Here are a few possible reasons:

1. Workload on the Assistant: Depending on the workload and capacity of the email triggering system or the assistant responsible for sending the emails, there may be delays in processing and sending out certain emails. If the system is handling a high volume of emails, it might prioritize the ones scheduled for immediate delivery and push the remaining ones to the next day.

2. Lead and Assistant Validation: The delay could also be due to the validation process of the lead email addresses and the assistant's workload. If the email addresses are being validated for accuracy and deliverability, some addresses may be flagged as "not certain to be valid." In such cases, these leads are put into a pending state, where processing is slowed down to avoid potential issues like email bounces or undeliverable messages.

3. Assistant Name and Lead Evaluation: By examining the lead and assistant names, it may be possible to identify whether the delay is intentional or due to workload. If certain leads consistently experience delays, it might indicate that they require additional evaluation or processing, leading to a slower delivery timeframe.
