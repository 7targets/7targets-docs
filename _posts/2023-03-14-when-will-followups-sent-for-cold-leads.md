To begin with, Lead is in a Cold state. The follow ups are done as per your sequence assigned to that lead. 

If the lead is engaged (emails opened), but not responded, the same sequence continues. 

If the lead clicks on an link in the email, lead status changes to warm, the same sequence continues. 

If the lead opens 3 or more emails, lead status changes to warm, the same sequence continues. 

If the lead responds to any email, lead status changes to responded. The sequence is stopped as soon as a lead responds. The assistant sends a notification to the user that “a lead xyz has responded. please check”.  

If the lead responds to any email with “Please send me your brochure”, the assistant sends a brochure automatically if you have configured your brochure link.  

If the lead responds to any email with “Contact me next month”, the assistant continues with same sequence, but changes the date of next email to the following month.
