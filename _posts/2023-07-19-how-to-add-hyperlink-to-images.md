Sometimes, you might want to include a call-to-action (CTA) image in your email and link it to a specific URL. This is indeed possible. Ensure that the image resembles a button and contains the appropriate text.

- In the Custom Message section, when creating or opening a custom message, you'll find an Image Icon. Clicking on this icon will open a popup that allows you to select the image you wish to hyperlink to a URL.
