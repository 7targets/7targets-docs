## Some notifications explained
Most of the notifications are self explanatory but below are few which may need explanation:

`Lead At Risk` notification is send by the Assistant to notify you of the leads who have responded and you have possibly not got back to them or you have not let the Assistant know that you reached out to the lead. Assistant can introduce you to the lead by using the `Introduce Me` action. If you reply the lead after this introduce me email, keeping Assistant in CC then Assistant will know that you have reached out to that lead and would not mark it as Lead at Risk, and will not notify/remind you.
