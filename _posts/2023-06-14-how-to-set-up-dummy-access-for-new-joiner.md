To set up a dummy access for the new joiner in any organisation, allowing them to practice with 7 targets while preventing any accidental editing of emails or tampering with data or email content, follow these steps:

1. If the new joiner will be using the same login, ensure that they understand that one person cannot edit another person's emails unless they are an organization admin.
2. Explain that their emails will appear in blue color to others, indicating that they cannot be edited unless the person is an org admin.
3. Optionally, inform the new joiner that they can use each other's emails by cloning them and then making edits.
4. Emphasize that practicing on the same login is acceptable and there will be no loss. Alternatively, they can practice on a different account, but it may be beneficial for them to explore ready-made sequences on your account.

By following these guidelines, you can provide the new joiner with a dummy access that ensures the safety of your data and email content while allowing them to practice with 7 targets effectively.
