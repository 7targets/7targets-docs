Generating leads is important. It creates sales and increases organic customers.
For Converting leads into customers, the salesperson needs to be on this toes, respond back quickly, do follow-ups.
Sometimes **salesperson forgets to do follow-ups** and the company looses a potential client. Which is a big cost.

According to what we have seen so far, EACH salesperson forgets to follow up **2 leads every month**. Some of them maybe junior sales, others maybe interns, but this list also includes founders of companies. 

Even if you assume a $1000 opportunity cost, 2 misses per month is $2000 per month. If youbhave 10 sales guys, its $20k missing in opportunity pipeline. 

In 7Targets, we have a feature of sending follow-up emails automatically, even after Sales person responds to the initial email from the prospect. This minimizes the human effort and increase the chances of conversion.

You can do this manually via your existing CRM with high discipline and regular meetings. Here's the explanation of how you can do successful follow-ups using 7Targets. 

## Step 1 
Select the files which you want to look into. If a Salesperson has uploaded leads using 3 files in last month, you can go to leads and select "multiple lead upload"

## Step 2
You can also select files the files you need from: Select "all filters".

## Step 3
Select the files you want to choose and then apply filters.
Now all the chosen leads will be shown

## Step 4
Click on responses.

Here you can see the number of responded leads. 

## Step 5
Click on one of the leads you want to first look into. 
Here, the 'Two Ticks' denotes that the email is opened by the lead. And the 'Link' icon means that the lead has clicked on one of the links in that email.

## Step 6

Dropping the leads
Here, the lead opened the email. You can also see that the lead has not opened any attached links.

Now here the salesperson thinks that he has sent the mail and his work is done but that’s the point where lead is dropped. After this communication, the entire conversation went cold, and your salesperson forgot to check back.

## Step 7
How to fix this problem of 'tracking leads that were sent an email already'? 

Assume we were to reply to the lead today. Click on the reply as shown in the image.
You’ll be directed to this page.

Scroll down and you’ll see the option “If no reply, followup using Reply follow-up schedule”

Tick that box and then follow ups will be activated. The Assistant will automatically followup this thread based on the schedule in 'Reply followup schedule'. You can create your own followup schedules for different types of follow-ups.

## Step 8

Here, are those 3 followup emails

Here’s the follow up message

That's how every month 2 leads are missed. Assuming the fact one lead is worth $1000, so per month you're facing a valuable loss of $2000.
To prevent this, try using 7Targets for an auto reply mechanism and you're safe from these traps.
