There are many scenarios where you may want to have a specific format. You may  format your email in some  other editor like Microsoft Word or Google docs. Then copy from there and paste it inside the custom message you are trying to create or edit. 

This may result into formatting issues because of formatting incompatibilities between these different softwares. So the resulting emails may not appear correctly when seen in different email clients. 

As different email clients behave differently, it is recommended to keep the formatting and font usage to basic. Two recommendations to avoid this formatting issue:
1. Type your email with in the 7Targets email editor
2. If copied from somewhere else, then remove the formatting and reformat within 7Targets email editor

## Step-1
A little background around formatting in documents. The documents written in Microsoft word is not designed to create a formatted text used in emails. the underline HTML code which is not seen causes issues when copied the pasted as is from softwares like Microsoft word.

## Step-2
To prevent formatting issues, best is to write the email in the custom message editor itself. Do all the formatting in the editor and save it. The saved message is not sent unless it is used in some schedule. So you can get the saved custom message reviewed from someone else in your team by sharing the name of the message. 

If that user is a Org Admin then can see and edit the message too. 

## Step-3
If you still need to copy the text from somewhere else, then best is to remove the formatting after pasting the text.

After the formatting is removed you can do the formatting in the custom message editor.
