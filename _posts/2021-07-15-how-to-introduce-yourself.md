Problem: An AI assistant interacts with hundreds of leads in parallel. When a lead responds to the AI assistant and asks for a meeting, now the AI assistant needs to introduce her boss to take the conversation forward. This is done using the following simple steps.

In the below example, the AI assistant got a response from a lead named Nicole asking a time for a meeting.
First, when assistant reads something like this, she marks this lead as a HOT lead. And then she forwards this HOT lead to her boss. 

Now her boss wants to introduce himself to the lead - Nicole.

So all you have to do is.

## Step-1

Click the lead URL that was sent to you in lead notification. If 7Targets is open, search for 'Nicole' on Lead list page.
