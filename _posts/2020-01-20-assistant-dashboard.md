**Overview of the Dashboard**:

The dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of the work done by your Assistant. It features various components, including filters and tabs, which allow you to analyze and monitor different aspects of your work. Here's a detailed breakdown of each component:

## Filters

1. **Time Filters**:
   - The dashboard offers multiple time filtering options to help you focus on specific time frames, including "day," "month," "quarter," "year," and the flexibility to set a "custom range." These filters are essential for tracking your work's progress over time.

2. **Assistant Filter**:
   - If you have multiple assistants, you can select one or more assistants to see a consolidated report for the selected individuals. This filter enables you to assess the contributions and performance of individual assistants.

3. **Sequence Filter**:
   - The sequence filter allows you to filter data based on sequences, making it a powerful tool for evaluating the effectiveness of your sequences and identifying trends in engagement and responses.

4. **Tags Filter**:
   - You can filter data based on tags associated with leads or other elements, aiding in the organization and categorization of your work for more targeted analysis.

- A pie chart visualizes lead statuses, making it easier to identify the distribution of leads in various stages.

5. **Total Leads**:
- This tile shows the total number of leads in your system, giving you an overview of your lead database's size.

6. **Active Leads**:
- Leads actively undergoing nurturing are referred to as "active leads."

7. **Link Clicked**:

12. **Out of Office**:
- Indicates leads that are currently marked as "out of office," helping you manage your communication strategy.

13. **Warm**:
- Warm leads are those who have opened your emails more than 3 times and, in some cases, clicked on specific links, indicating their interest in your product.

14. **Time Saved on Leads**:
- Displays the amount of time saved through automation or efficiency in lead management.

15. **Leads at Risk**:
- Failing to respond to a lead within 24 hours of their response results in marking the lead as 'Lead At Risk' (LAR).

- Processed leads are those whose follow-up is completed according to the sequence. These leads are most likely to be put on Long term nurturing sequence.

By using the available filters in combination with these tabs, you can tailor your analysis to specific timeframes, assistant performance, sequences, and tags, making the dashboard a powerful tool for monitoring and optimizing your work.
