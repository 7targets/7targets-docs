When a new contact is added to the system it is called 'New' state.

When the email sequence is just started then it is called 'Cold' state.

When lead responds then it becomes 'Hot' lead.

If hot lead opens emails around 3 or 4 times,  it becomes a 'Warm' lead.

If the person unsubscribes then it is called 'Unsubscribed' lead.

When you don't want to send any communication that's called a 'Deactivated' state.

When a person doesn't open any email or remains cold until the end of the follow-ups then it is called 'Processed' state.
