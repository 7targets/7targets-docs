AI Sales Assistant will categorize the leads in various states based on the followups and responses. These states are there for the user to help focus on the right leads for better conversion. 

Refer this to know about various [lead states]({{ site.baseurl }}/assigning-leads/lead-responses/#lead-state)  
Leads with some specific states may need different handling.  
For e.g. Hot leads needs immediate attention and Assistant will followup with you if Hot Leads are not taken care of, will also mark them Lead At Risk.  
Refer this for [Warm leads processing]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to/how-to-process-warm-leads/).

Lets understand how various state, filters, actions and tags work together.

## Step-1

Select the States filter drop down and filter by Processed state.

When a person doesn’t open any email or remains Cold until the end of the follow-ups then it is marked as ‘Processed’ state.

Lets filter and look at a Warm lead. Note the double-ticks which convey that lead has opened your emails and so is marked as Warm too.  
Assistant would have even optimized the send time to make sure that emails are delivered to the lead at a time when he/she opens the emails.

If you want to send some other messages to a processed lead then click on 'Restart Followup'.
