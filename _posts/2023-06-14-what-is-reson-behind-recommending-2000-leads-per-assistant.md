The recommendation to have 2000 leads per assistant is based on the limitations set by Google regarding the number of emails that can be sent from a single email address. Google restricts sending more than 250 emails per day from a single address to prevent spamming issues. To avoid such problems, our assistant has a safety limit of 200 emails per day.

Assigning 2000 leads per assistant allows for efficient handling of the workload. For example, if you assign 1000 leads, it takes approximately one week to send one email to each lead. With 2000 leads, it takes around two weeks to send one email to each lead.

This number works well because it accommodates new leads that may require multiple emails in their first month. For older leads, emails are typically sent at longer intervals. If you have more than 2000 leads, it is recommended to create additional assistants, which can be easily done by cloning an existing assistant. Creating multiple assistants ensures faster and more effective communication with your leads.

Considering the optimal workflow and the capabilities of our premium package, creating 4 to 5 assistants for a lead count of 6000 would improve efficiency and allow each lead to be handled promptly.
