Send time optimization refers to the process of scheduling emails to be delivered at the most optimal time for each individual recipient based on their past engagement patterns. By analyzing the recipient's historical email open and click rates, send time optimization algorithms determine the best time to send the email to maximize the chances of it being opened and acted upon.

For example, if a recipient tends to read emails at 10:00 AM, but the scheduled time for sending the email is set for 3:00 PM, the send time optimization system will adjust the delivery to the next day around 10:00 AM. This ensures that the email arrives in the recipient's inbox at a time when they are most likely to engage with it.

Additionally, send time optimization takes into account holidays and other factors that may affect email engagement. If a scheduled delivery falls on a holiday or a non-optimal period when recipients are less likely to check their emails, the system will automatically push the email schedule to a more suitable time to improve the chances of successful engagement.

By leveraging send time optimization, email senders can enhance the effectiveness of their campaigns by delivering messages at the right moment when recipients are most likely to pay attention to their emails, leading to higher open rates and better overall engagement.
