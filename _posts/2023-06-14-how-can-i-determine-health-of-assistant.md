The health of the assistant is dependent on the number of leads assigned to the assistant. To maintain optimal performance, it is recommended to assign a maximum of 2000 leads to an assistant. If you have exceeded this threshold, it's advisable to split the workload among many additional assistants.

By distributing the load among multiple assistants, you can ensure efficient handling of all leads.
