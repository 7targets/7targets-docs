Click on responses.

Here you can see the number of leads and other information such as email and content 



## Step 5

Click on one of the leads you want to first act upon
Here, the 'Two Ticks' denotes that the email is opened by the receiver. And the 'Link' icon means that the receiver has clicked on one of the links in that email.

## Step 6

Dropping the leads

Here, the client opened the email but he didn’t open any attached link.

Now here the salesperson thinks that he has sent the mail and his work is done but that’s the point where leads are dropped.

## Step 7
How to fix this.

Click on the reply as shown in the image.
You’ll be directed to this page.

Scroll down and you’ll see the option “If no reply, followup using Reply follow schedule”

Tick that box and then follow ups will be activated.

## Step 8

Here, are those 3 followup emails

Here’s the follow up message

That's how every month 2 leads are missed. Assuming the fact one lead is worth $1000, so per month you're facing a valuable loss of $2000.
To prevent this, try using 7Targets for an auto reply mechanism and you're safe from these traps.
