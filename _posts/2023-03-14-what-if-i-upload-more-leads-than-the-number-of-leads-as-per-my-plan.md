If you upload 76 leads on a day, and the assistant picks the first 50 leads, the remaining 26 will be picked up automatically by the assistant on the next day. You do not have to do anything here. 

If the assistant was already assigned 40 leads on Day 2 morning by someone other user using the same assistant, then the assistant will consolidate the 40+26 leads - total 66. Assistant will sort the 66 leads by time, and process the first 50 leads. Remaining 16 leads will be moved to next available day.
