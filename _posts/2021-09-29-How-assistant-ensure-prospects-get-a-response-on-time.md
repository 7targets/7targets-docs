When the assistant is not able to answer questions to the lead, the Assistant forwards the prospect’s email to the sales representative. If there is no response within 24 hrs from the sales representative then the assistant mark that lead as ‘Lead at risk’. 
Let’s have a look at how the ‘lead at risk’ feature works?

## Action that assitant will take when he is unable to answer question of prospect.


Consider a scenario where the user named Sanju is the owner of an assistant named Oliver. Oliver will forward the prospect’s email to Sanju if Oliver cannot respond to the lead automatically. Sanju should respond within 24 hrs.
