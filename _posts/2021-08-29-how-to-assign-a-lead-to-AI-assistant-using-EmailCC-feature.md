Apart from new lead follow-up, customers use AI Assistants for Quotation followups, proposal follow-ups, and payment followups as well. All you need to do is to CC the appropriate assistant when sending the quotation or proposal email to your prospect/lead.

Follow these simple steps to exclude domains and email addresses.

## Step1
Create schedule for EmailCC. You can clone `Recommended for Email CC` schedule already existing in Org Messages under Schedule.
`Note, For Email-CC schedules, follow-up will start with the SECOND message. Your email, where you cc the assistant is considered as the first email, hence the first email in the E-mail CC schedule is ignored.`

## Step2
Go to assistant and click on `Edit Assistant` or you can create a new Assistant too.

## Step3
Scroll down and click on `Defaults` to expand

## Step4
For Default Email-CC Schedule, choose the schedule you created for e-mail CC in step1 from the drop-down list.

## Step5
Scroll down and click on `Options` to expand it

## Step6
Select checkboxes `Add Lead when assistant is Cc'ed in email`, `Mark Email CC Leads at risk when Processed with no Response` and `Automatically add Lead referenced in out of office email`. Blue tick appears as you select/check them.

## Step7
Click on the `Save` button on the bottom left corner of your screen

## Step8 
Copy AI Assistant Email address

## Step9
Open your email client (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) to send an email to the lead and CC the assistant by pasting the assistant e-mail id we copied in step 9.
[Note, The Email address you use to add leads using the E-mail CC feature must be ‘Assistant user’ Link to check assistant user https://solution.7targets.com/assigned-to-users] 

## Step10 
Assistant will send a confirmation email notification after the lead is added, so you can make any changes if you want to.
