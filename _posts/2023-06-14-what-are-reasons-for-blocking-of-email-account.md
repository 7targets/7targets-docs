An email account can get blocked when the content and subject lines of the emails are deemed spammy. This can happen regardless of whether the emails are sent through 7Targets or any other platform. However, 7Targets works to minimize the likelihood of such blocks occurring by reducing the chances of emails being flagged as spam.
