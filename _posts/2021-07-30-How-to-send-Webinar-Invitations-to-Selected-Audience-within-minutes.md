When the leads have opened your emails once or multiple times but haven’t responded, you may want to increase their engagement by organizing a webinar. But listing these leads and sending invitations to them individually can be very time consuming.

To ease this process, 7Targets provides you with a separate list of warm and hot leads, a broadcast message feature and even a webinar invitation library to choose from. Using these, you can send invitations to 100s and 1000s of leads within minutes.

Follow the simple steps below for sending the invitations.

## Step 1

Click on the ‘Dashboard’ tab.

## Step 2

Scroll down. If you want to invite only warm leads, click on the ‘Warm (*%)’. If you wish to send the invitation to the leads who have opened the email only once, click on the ‘Engaged (**%)’.
