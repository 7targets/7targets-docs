Company name is used by the Assistant in the AI generated email subjects. Assistant’s email address too is derived from the company name. You can change the Company name and email address of Assistant later.

Note the generated signature. You can always edit the signature later.

Some of our customers use the Assistant title as “Executive Assistant to self”. While some use Assistant’s name as their own name. It is your choice finally.
