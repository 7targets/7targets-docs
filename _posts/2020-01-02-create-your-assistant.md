## Add Assistant

Your Assistant is identified by name, email address and title. It is `recommended to have a geography specific name` for better connect with your leads, for e.g. Ashley or John will be able to connect better in the Americas. You can always change the name later.

Let’s pick or type an appropriate title. 

Company name is used by the Assistant in the AI generated email subjects. Assistant’s email address too is derived from the company name. You can change the Company name and email address of Assistant later.

Note the generated signature. You can always edit the signature later.

Some of our customers use the Assistant title as “Executive Assistant to self”. While some use Assistant’s name as their own name. It is your choice finally. 

Click the button to create your Assistant and go to the next step.

## Use your Exchange Server
While adding or creating Assistant, there is an option `I want to use my own domain`. On clicking it, you would be asked to authorize the email/account you want to use for the Assistant being created. 

Assistant will send emails from ths email id using the authorized account. As well Assistant will email responses received and act accordingly.
