## Add Assistant

Your Assistant is identified by name, email address and title. It is `recommended to have a geography specific name` for better connect with your leads, for e.g. Ashley or John will be able to connect better in the Americas. You can always change the name later.

Let’s pick or type an appropriate title. 

Company name is used by the Assistant in the AI generated email subjects. Assistant’s email address too is derived from the company name. You can change the Company name and email address of Assistant later.

Note the generated signature. You can always edit the signature later.

Some of our customers use the Assistant title as “Executive Assistant to self”. While some use Assistant’s name as their own name. It is your choice finally. 

Click the button to create your Assistant and go to the next step.

## Use Own Domain
Can I use my email or my domain as Assistant Email ?  
Yes, you can and it comes with risking your domain as well limits of your email server.  
We cannot do a apparent `from` for your email/domain and do a `reply-to` to assistants email id. As it would mean different domain for `from` and `reply-to`, which impacts the email deliverability. 

If you want to use your own domain+email as Assistants email address then we support it for Exchange Server, Gmail and Outlook for Business. Steps are mentioned below. 

**If you still want to use this feature, we highly recommend to create a new email-id on your email server and use that for the Assistant.**

*Let's test it now*
1. Go to add a lead screen in 7Targets, and try adding one lead abc@xyz.com(this is just example, provide a valid email) to Ashley. 
1. Make sure you select ‘Now’, to ensure you can test the email has gone out immediately. 
1. Check if the abc got the email. 
1. Have abc reply to the email “I am interested. Call me”. 
1. Give it a couple of minutes and check if Ashleys lead list shows abc as a HOT lead. 
1. If you don’t see abc's response in 7Targets, check if abc@xyz.com response email has landed into the spam folder in Ashley’s GMail box. 
1. If it’s in the spam folder, then your spam rule in the above steps need to be set properly once again.
