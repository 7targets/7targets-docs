No, reauthorization itself does not have any direct impact on spamming. It is simply the process of authorizing 7Targets to send emails through a Microsoft (MS) account. In the past, we have encountered a few reauthorization issues, but those were unrelated to spamming. They occurred when MS or Google had blocked the email or domain, preventing 7Targets from sending emails.
