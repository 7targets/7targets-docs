## [What you get](#what-you-get)
To connect a customers existing CRM (such as Salesforce, Hubspot, Pipedrive, Zoho or any of the 100s oF CRMs), we can do that using 7Target's Zapier integration.

Zapier already has integrations with hundreds of CRMs. Its an integration hub. 7Targets also integrates with Zapier, allowing 7Targets to communicate with any other well known CRM in the world.

If a customers CRM is not well known, or is home grown, and does not have a integration with Zapier, then we have APIs that we have exposed so they can call those APIs and connect to 7Targets via APIs.

The Zapier 7Targets Integration is still private and is not yet on the Zapier public marketplace. So when you want to use it in any of the Zap that you want to create just drop us an email at support@7targets.com and we will provide you the access.
