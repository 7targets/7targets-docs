Number of Valid leads created in last 7 days:
- TVL = Filter by Create Date for last 7 days. 

Number of leads actually bounced in last 7 days.
- Bounced Leads = Filter by Modified in last 7 days and State Deactivated->Bounce Deactivated.

Bounce Rate = (Bounced Leads * 100) / TVL

If the Bounce rate is 4% or more then the leads identified as Bounce Risk will be put in status Deactivated->Bounce Risk.
