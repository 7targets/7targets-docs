## Overview
7Targets AI assistant works around the clock to send followup using scheduled date till it's daily limit is reached. But Sometimes you only want to send followups during certain time such that lead can immediately read & respond to those followups.

To send followups during desired timing you can set a time range only during which followups will be sent.

You can set this preference using following steps

1. Go to Assistant Preference from left side bar
2. Select an assistant for which you want to set Business Hours
3. Select Desired Timezone
3. Add Start and End time preference for Time Range.

Now Assistant will only send further followups during time range defined by Start Time and End Time.
