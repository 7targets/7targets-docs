7Targets Assistant has a default sequence. And when assigning the contact to the assistnat in Hubspot the default sequence would be picked up. But sometime you want some other sequence to be used instead of default sequence of Assisant. You can do this by following below steps.steps:
## Case 1: 
`When you add a new Contact/s on Hubspot.`
## Step 1:
When you click on `Create Contact` on Hubspot, the following side pane will open up. Do not assign any owner to your contact and click on `Create`

## Step 2:
Once the contact is created, edit the sequence of your choice in the field `7Targets Sequence`.

## Step 3:
Now assign the contact owner to the contact from the `Contact owner` field. This will get the 7Targets Assistant started with the sequence provided in the above step. If above step is not done then the default sequence of the Assistant is picked up.

## Step 4:
Verify the sequence for these contacts/leds. Go to 7Targets and there you can check the sequence of the particular lead is changed according to what you had specified in Step 2.

You can do this for multiple contact at a time too. In Hubspot, on selecting multiple contacts change the 7Targets Sequence value using the Edit action before changing the owner to the Assistant. 

Important point to note for reassignment of Contact in Hubspot to Assistant, you have to change the 7Targets Sequence value to something else or delete the value else same Sequence will be picked up again.
