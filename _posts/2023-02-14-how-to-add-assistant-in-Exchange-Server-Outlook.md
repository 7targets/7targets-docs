## Create a new email id in your Exchange Server
Decide the name of your assistant and create that email id in your corporate exchange server. 
For example: lets assume the assistant name is Emma. And your company is abccorp.com
Create Emma@abccorp.com

## Click on Add Assistant
Open 7Targets. 
Go to the Assistants top menu. 
And click on 'Add Assistant' button. 
Dont worry about giving a name to this assistant, because Assistant will pick up Emma's name directly from your exchange server email id.  

## Use my own domain
Scroll down, Click on 'Use my own domain' - a green colored check box. 
Choose Exchange Server from the following popup. 
MAKE SURE you select Emma assistant email address account in Exchange server. 

Do NOT select your own email account. 

## Authorize 7Targets to use Exchange email box
Once you select Emma@abccorp.com, it will ask you to approve and authorize 7Targets to allow connection with Emma's email box. 7Targets needs READ and WRITE access to Emma's box so it can work as an assistant, like any other human assistant. 

Provide those permissions. 

## Send test email
Go to Custom Messages, select a custom message, and send test email. 
Make sure you see the Emma Assistant in the top icon's. This ensures that Emma assistant is selected while sending the email. 

If you have any further doubts, you can directly mail us at support@7targets.com.
