## Step-1
The "Todays Followup" widget on dashboard shows the count and details of the leads which are going to receive the email today. 

Completed or emails already sent today is also available with a toggle. 

On click of the Count, you will be taken to the lead list in case you want to make some changes. 
Clicking on one lead will open that specific lead for you to view or make changes to schedule email.
