Assistant automatically categorizes leads in various types like engaged, responded, hot, warm, cold leads, etc. 
Let’s see the significance of a feature called “Link Click”  This feature shows which links were clicked by leads.
We can call the ‘link click feature’, as a focus item because we can monitor and analyze which link the lead clicked from the email sent to the lead. 



## Case 1 

Below is a dashboard. Here we have 342 end-users who have clicked on links. 
Click on this number to drill down into the details.

Select one lead

Now the information of leads is displayed.
 In this case, Emma is the assistant who is nurturing this lead.
You can see in the image below that the lead has clicked a link on 9th June. There is a small link icon that shows that the lead has clicked a link.
Now we can go ahead and click on 9th June.

Now a ‘Re-follow up’ dialog box will appear. Here we can see the email that was sent to the lead and the URL of the link which the lead has clicked.

The next step is to visit the social media accounts of the lead and also the website of the lead, (if provided) to know more about the lead.

We select the link notification option. Insert the link URL and assign the time limit.
So within that time, we will be notified if a lead or end-user clicks the links.
