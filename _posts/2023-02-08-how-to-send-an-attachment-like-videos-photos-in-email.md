Two ways to send attachments, you-tube videos or photos. 
## Steps
1. Use links (URLs) to those files and videos in the email. 
2. Use your normal email client (like gmail) for sending the first email and cc the Assistant in that email.  
The Assistant understands that she needs to followup that leads using the 'Email CC' sequence.
