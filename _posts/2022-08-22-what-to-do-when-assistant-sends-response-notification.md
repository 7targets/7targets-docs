Assistant notifies the user on receiving a favourable response from the lead. So that user can act on it. 

User has multiple ways of handling this situation.
- Introduce yourself or someone in the team to take the discussion ahead. 
- Send email as Assistant

If user do not take care of the response in 24 hrs then lead is marked at risk and Assistant follows up with the lead owner, which the user can disable if the action is taken outside of the system.
