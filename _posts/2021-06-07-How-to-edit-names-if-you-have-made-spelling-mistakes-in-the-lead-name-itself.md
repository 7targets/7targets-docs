If you have entered the wrong names of leads while uploading the lead list into 7targets, then the AI sales assistant will be using the wrong name in the salutation. 

This will not create a good impression on the lead and you might lose one.

So to change the name for the lead after uploading them, follow the below steps.


## Step 1
Click on the "edit" icon.
