As a salesperson, you need to respond back to the lead within 24 hours of leads response, otherwise that lead is marked as 'Lead At Risk'.  

Assistant goal is to ensure that leads who have responded should not fall through the cracks.

As a sales person, you need to respond back to the lead within 24 hours, otherwise that lead is marked as `LeadAtRisk`.  
If you already responded and have not copied the Assistant in your reply, you can click on the link in the notification email and mark the lead as Not at risk.  
If you donâ€™t do that, the Assistant will continue to remind you to work on this lead every 3 days.  
You can change the duration of reminders.
