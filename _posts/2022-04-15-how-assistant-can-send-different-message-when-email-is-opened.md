This came as a request from one of our long time customers. 

They wanted to send a different email sequence when lead opened an email. 

Now it is possible by setting a preference. Select the schedule to be used when the lead open an email. If the existing schedule is different that the preference then the lead would be put on this preferred schedule. 

To avoid sending duplicate emails, the preferred schedule and existing schedule is checked. If it is same then this preference does not come in effect.

Below are the steps to use this feature. 

## Step-1
This is Assistant specific preference. So open the preference page and go to the preference show in below image. 

Select the schedule you want. If it is left empty then this preference does not apply, which is the default behavior too.

Remember to save after change. 

## Step-2
If this preference is not set then the behavior is as it is today. 

That is, the Cold lead can become Engaged and then Warm based on number of emails opened by the lead.
