Schedule Sequence helps you decide how you want the assistant to followup. i.e.

**-** how many followups

**-** days between each followup

Assistant comes with two default schedules **Recommended** and **Recommended for Email CC**. You can clone from one of these schedules and create a new one, providing an appropriate name and description.

## Step 9

After saving the schedule you may want to mark it default for the selected/specific Assistant. So that when you add leads for this assistant the default schedule is selected.

Click on the drop-down arrow as shown. Select the AI assistant you want to assign the new schedule to.

The custom schedule gives you the ability to pick the number of followups and the days between each appropriately, along with the messages to be sent on each followup.
