## What is 7Targets & How does it work ?
7Targets AI Assistants, is focused on helping B2B companies. Our goals are simple. Targets is an AI-powered B2B sales solution that intend to assists companies in achieving multi-million dollar sales success within 4 to 5 years. It works by creating virtual sales teams, employing specialized sales approaches, and utilizing long terms nurturing, chatbots and data analytics to engage leads and ensure consistent follow-ups.

What we did is nothing new. We have tried to replicate what large companies do in their sales organizations.

**Creating many small virtual sales teams in different countries:**
   - Specialists instead of generalist sales
   - Sales Conversational chatbots on websites to answer questions for anyone at any time
   - Provide just 2 to 3 pages of technology info followed by 10-15 slides of success stories, showing the deep prowess one has within a market segment.

## From a management perspective

**Ability to identify and make a call on whether to continue in a market segment or not.**
   - Make the process of zoning onto ICP crisper so that the ideal customer profile truly wants your product.

## How we do this?

**Figure out which leads are engaging more with you in each market segment.**
   - Get timely notifications on your WhatsApp, so you can connect with the lead immediately.
   - Get details like how many seconds were spent by the lead on which page of your brochure, so you know the inclination of what your lead is interested in.
   - Ability to expose the same knowledge model created from your website content via chat and email.

## Let our Assistants do the repetative work
- Instead of getting blocked due to bounced emails, allow assistants to find valid/invalid email addresses. **Allow assistants to keep the bounce rate under 4%**
- Allow the assistant to remember opening times of when someone opens an email, so the next email is sent around that time, increasing the chances of opening the email.
- Allow the assistant to follow up after meetings, after sending proposals. Do not drop a lead even by mistake. Follow up, follow up, follow up.
- Allow the assistant to follow up with you and your team if your team does not answer a lead's question within 24 hours. Do not allow your team to drop a lead.
