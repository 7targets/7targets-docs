## [What you get](#what-you-get)
7Targets AI Sales Assistant is created as a user in **Odoo CRM**.
Leads from Odoo CRM can be assigned to 7Targets AI Sales Assistant directly within Odoo CRM. AI Assistant will then own the lead, communicate, and nurture to try and get the meeting. Assistant will update the communication details (email, task) in Odoo for each contact the Assistant is nurturing.

One important point to note, after AI Assistant is done with her job, she will assign the lead back to the original owner.

## State definitions
 Various possible state are:   
`New` conveys that the lead added cannot be processed as you have used up your leads limit as per the plan. You can Restart these leads in the next period or upgrade your plan and then restart these leads now.  
`Cold` the followup is under progress.   
`Hot` if the lead has accepted to meet.   
`Warm` lead is someone who has opened 3 or more emails or has clicked on a link from the email. A good list for your calling team to call.  
`Engaged` lead is someone who has opened 1 or more emails.  
`Processed` followup is completed as per the sequence and there was no response from the lead.    
`Out of office` received an out of office from the lead. Assistant will restart the followup after lead returns back to office.
 [What if the next email for the lead is going beyond the out of office date for the lead ?]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to/what-if-the-next-email-for-lead-is-going-beyond-out-of-office-date-for-lead/)

`Deactivated` lead responded back asking to stop sending emails. Lead email id is invalid as verified by the assistant. Email sent to the lead bounced.  
`Unsubscribed` lead used the unsubscribed link in the email or responded asking to unsubscribe. You wont be able to send any more emails to this lead.  
`Responded` state for the lead conveys that there is some response from the lead and Assistant was not able to categorize it to one of the above.  
`Pending` means the email id was NOT certain to be valid (Un-verifiable), so Assistant will process these leads at a slower rate to avoid getting into Bounce issues.

## How to Use the Assistant
After all the configurations are completed, users can assign leads to the assistant in two ways:
1. When sending a proposal email (from outside Odoo) to the lead, copy the assistant in that email. The Assistant will create the lead, sync with Odoo, and use the right sequence as per the stage mapping.
2. From Odoo CRM itself, select/edit the deal. Update the Assistant and Sequence (if required), then save the lead.

- Click on Sync Assistant & Schedule Button after creating / Updating Assistants/schedules. It will sync all the sequences/ assistants
- To unassign the lead from the Assistant, just remove the Assistant from the lead and save it.

## More Details
   - Assistant will update the activities/notes for each email being sent or received.
   - There is a 7Targets Lead Connection Status field for each lead in Odoo CRM, which shows the current status of the lead in 7Targets. This field also acts as a safeguard to accidentally reassign the lead to the Assistant. For reassignment, this field value has to be made empty.
   - Lead in 7Targets is uniquely identified by the customer email from the Odoo CRM Lead.
