When the leads have opened your emails once or multiple times but haven't responded, you may want to increase their engagement by organizing a webinar. But listing these leads and sending invitations to them individually can be very time consuming.

To ease this process, 7Targets provides you with a separate list of warm and hot leads, a broadcast message feature and even a webinar invitation library to choose from. Using these, you can send invitations to 100s and 1000s of leads within minutes.

Follow the simple steps below for sending the invitations.

## Step 1

Sign in to your account.

Go to the 'Organisation' tab.

You can also add images such as the presenter just by dragging the image into the message box and dropping it.

To link presenter's description, select the text you want to link it to (Here, it is 'Brief about Janice'). 

Click on the 'Link' icon. A dialog box will appear, paste the URL there and hit the 'Save' button on the dialog box.

After finalizing the invitation message, click on the 'Save' button as shown.
