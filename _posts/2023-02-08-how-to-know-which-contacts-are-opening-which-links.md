If links in the emails are clicked or opened by the lead, then a link icon in the timeline view just next to the double-tick(this represents email opened by the lead) would be an indication to convey this.  
Hover over the link icon to know how many links from that email are clicked.  
On click of it, the email is shown along with the details of which link is clicked by the lead.
