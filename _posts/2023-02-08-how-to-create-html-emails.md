7Targets supports basic HTML, same level of gmail.com. We believe in human-like 1-1 emails. Hence our platform supports a basic editor like a user would use to send an manual email.

If you have an HTML email template, you cannot copy-paste or import it from your local PC and create a custom HTML message in 7Targets.

Similar to a simple gmail like editor, you can create a custom message containing pictures and relevant links. But if you are looking for sending fancy HTML multi-column email layouts for bulk emailing, this is not the right solution for you. 

## Reason
We believe HTML emails get high spams/unsubscribes and lowest responses. And personally written 1 on 1 emails get higher open, lesser Unsubscribes and higher responses.

Hence we support simulating 1 on 1 human like text emails. Like twitter, you can link images/videos, but text platforms get more human traction.

Since 1 on 1 email are not written as HTML, so we do not support HTML editors.

If you are looking to simulate a scaled version of a human 1 on 1 communication, then 7Targets AI Assistants is the right tool.
