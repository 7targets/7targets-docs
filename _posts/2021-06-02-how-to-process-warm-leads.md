After you have uploaded the leads and the follow-up has started, you'll see few leads marked as 'Warm Leads'. The warms leads are the ones who have opened your emails more than 3 times. It shows that they are interested in your product.

These are the leads that have highest chance of convertion if you follow-up promptly.

In 7targets, we have a feature, when a lead opens your email for the third time, you'll receive a notification on WhatsApp message and a mail within 5 minutes. This helps you to act on that lead quickly.

Below is the explanation of how you can act upon these warm leads.

## Step 1

Sign in to your account. You'll be landed on the 'Dashboard'.

## Step 3

Here, the 'Two Ticks' denotes that the email is opened by the receiver. And the 'Link' icon means that receiver has clicked on one of the links in that email.

As you can see the leads have opened the email for the third time, it will be marked as warm and notification will be sent to your WhatsApp and on Email.

## Step 5

You will be directed to this page.

Once you know that the lead is warm, you need to understand a little bit about them and their background so that you can contact them in a more personalized way.

As highlighted below, if you click on the 'World' icon, it will take you to the lead's website.

Similarly, if clicked on the 'in' icon, it will take you to the browser where generally 1st link is to the lead's LinkedIn profile.

And when you click on the 'Case' icon, you can know if they are hiring someone.

This saves a lot of time spent on searching the information of the lead.

Now, you have gathered pretty much information about the person and his background in just a few clicks.
