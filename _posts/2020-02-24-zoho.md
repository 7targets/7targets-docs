## [What you get](#what-you-get)
  
Leads and Deals from **Zoho** CRM can be assigned to 7Targets AI Sales Assistant directly within Zoho. AI Assistant will then own the lead, communicate and nurture to try and get the meeting. Assistant will update the communication details (emails) in Zoho for each lead or deal she/he is nurturing. 

One **important** point to note, after AI Assistant is done with her job, she will assign the lead back to the original owner.

## [How it works](#how-it-works)
- After the Leads or deal in Zoho is assigned to the Assistant in Zoho, Assistant will own it for nurturing. Assistant will use the default Schedule and Context as configured in 7Targets.
- Assistant will leave a note of confirmation like below image for the assigned  lead or deal.
![Confirmation Note from Assistant](../../images/hubspot-7targets-confirmation-note.png)
- All the emails that Assistant sends or receives are logged in Zoho too. Like in below image. 
![Logged Email by Assistant](../../images/hubspot-7targets-email.png)
- After Assistant is done with her work, the lead or deal is assigned back to the previous owner. For example, if there is a response from the lead, then Assistant will stop further emails and assign it back to the previous owner. 

**Can I provide the context from Zoho while assigning the lead or deal to the assistant?**  
Yes. 7Targets adds a `7Targets_Context` field to the Zoho Lead and Deal and you can provide the value for it from Zoho. If a value is provided then Assistant uses that instead of the default Context.  
**Can I see the 7Targets Lead status in Zoho?**  
Yes. 7Targets adds a field `7Targets_Lead_Connection_Status` to the Zoho Lead and Deal and Assistant will keep it updated as the lead turn from Cold to Warm to Hot. You can add this field to your view or filter on it as required. 

## Re-assignment of Zoho Lead or Deal
Re-assignment of a lead/deal from Zoho would not be picked by the Assistant for processing. This is to avoid accidental re-assignments, when user does multiple select and assign to the Assistant in Zoho.  
In such a scenario, Assistant would leave a note and assign the lead/deal back to the previous owner.
