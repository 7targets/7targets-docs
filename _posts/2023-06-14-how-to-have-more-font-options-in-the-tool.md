# video_id: 6xyI5NNCCmc
description:  The system is designed for simple text-based personal-looking communications. While we are not as constricted as platforms like WhatsApp or Twitter, we do limit the font options to those supported by Gmail. This helps maintain a personalized touch and avoids the perception that the email is a generic mass message. The goal is to create sales specialists who can quickly establish a connection with the reader.

If you are looking to have more font options in the tool, we recommend considering the following guidelines:

1. Stick to Supported Fonts: The tool limits font options to those supported by Gmail. This ensures compatibility across different email clients and avoids potential display issues.

2. Focus on Personalization: Instead of relying on fancy or elaborate fonts, prioritize personalization in the email content itself. Tailor the message to the recipient's needs, using relevant and engaging language.

3. Use Formatting Techniques: You can still enhance the visual appeal of your emails by utilizing formatting techniques such as bold, italics, underline, and bullet points. These can help draw attention to key points and make the email more visually appealing without relying solely on font choices.

4. Experiment with Styles and Sizes: While font choices may be limited, you can play around with different font styles (e.g., Arial, Verdana, Times New Roman) and sizes to create subtle variations and highlight important sections.

5. Consider Web Fonts for External Communications: If you are creating content for external communications, such as landing pages or web-based marketing materials, you can explore the use of web fonts. The provided link (https://www.litmus.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-web-fonts/) offers a comprehensive guide to web fonts that can help you understand the possibilities and implementation techniques.

Remember, the main focus of the tool is to establish a personal connection with the reader, so while font options may be limited, the content and messaging are key.
